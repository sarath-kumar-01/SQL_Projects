# Project Description
I've done a analysis on IMDb dataset to find the key-insights on total movies, movie ratings, director mapping, actor mapping,
yearly movie release trend, data modelling using ER-diagram, using the join functions and stored procedures, to get the desired 
output by writting the complex queries and using the insights to provide the understanding about the movie revenue, success rate,
cast repeatency and yearly trend on the movies.
