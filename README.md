# Repo Description
I've done few projects in data analysis using the SQL environments to create and understand the working of database,to load the data into the database,
to connect the tables through data modelling using ER(Entity Relationship)-diagrams, to manipulate the data in the database using complex queries to get
the desired output and also to provide a meaningful insights to add value in the growth of the company.
